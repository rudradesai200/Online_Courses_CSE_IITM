      <description>The computer is often a very handy tool when solving complex technical problems in engineering and scientific explorations. Programming a computer is a fundamental task in finding solutions to such problems.
Objectives This course is being offered in order to train the undergraduate students in IIT Madras (from various engineering and science departments) in the fundamentals of programming. The course aims to provide exposure to problem-solving through programming. It aims to train the student to the basic concepts of the C-programming language.</description>

      <description>The objective of the course is to introduce students to the foundations of computation.
Objectives The objective of the course is to introduce students to the foundations of computation. We ask fundamental questions like &amp;ldquo;What does it mean for a function to be computed?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Are all functions computable?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Is there a way to measure the hardness of computing a function?&amp;rdquo; We will see that the above questions are deep, and in the quest for answering them we will learn some fundamental concepts such as state, transition, reduction, decidability.</description>

      <description>The objective of the course is to teach programming (with an emphasis on problem solving) and introduce elementary data structures.
Objectives The objective of the course is to teach programming (with an emphasis on problem solving) and introduce elementary data structures. The student should, at a rudimentary level, be able to prove correctness (loop invariants, conditioning, etc) and analyze efficiency (using the `O&#39; notation).

      <description>This course provides foundations of the practical implementation and usage of advanced Algorithms and Data Structures
Objectives The course is intended to provide the foundations of the practical implementation and usage of Algorithms and Data Structures. One objective is to ensure that the student evolves into a competent programmer capable of designing and analyzing implementations of algorithms and data structures for different kinds of problems. The second objective is to expose the student to the algorithm analysis techniques, to the theory of reductions, and to the classification of problems into complexity classes like NP.</description>

      <description>Paradigm can also be termed as method to solve some problem or do some task. Programming paradigm is an approach to solve problem using some programming language or also we can say it is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach.
Objectives The course gives an overview of programming paradigms. It deals with the concepts common in various imperative programming languages.</description>

      <description>Online Courses initiative by IIT Madras Our goal is to provide high quality education to the masses. It has been estimated that the IITs have an acceptance rate of less than 2%, so only a small portion of students make the cut. Only students who enter the hallowed halls of academia are able to gain access to pertinent content. But there are several talented students, from local colleges, whose talent needs to be fostered because they cannot gain access to quality education.</description>
