Paradigm can also be termed as method to solve some problem or do some task. Programming paradigm is an approach to solve problem using some programming language or also we can say it is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach.

# Objectives
The course gives an overview of programming paradigms. It deals with the concepts common in various imperative programming languages. Furthermore, object-oriented programming is thaught. The fundamentals of declarative programming paradigm and its use in modern programming languages are illustrated as well. The final course topic covers the use of parallelism.
