This course provides foundations of the practical implementation and usage of advanced Algorithms and Data Structures

# Objectives
The course is intended to provide the foundations of the practical implementation and usage of Algorithms and Data Structures. One objective is to ensure that the student evolves into a competent programmer capable of designing and analyzing implementations of algorithms and data structures for different kinds of problems. The second objective is to expose the student to the algorithm analysis techniques, to the theory of reductions, and to the classification of problems into complexity classes like NP.

# Course Contents
The [content of this course](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/course_details.php?arg=MzM=) can be viewed in four different threads each telling a different story of the same material. The first one is based on the design paradigms of algorithms, the second one based on task of choosing the right data structure, the third one based on the type of analysis (like worst case, amortized etc) that one would like to do and the fourth one based on the domain from which the algorithmic problems come from.

We will follow the first one and describe the thread relates to the other views too, during the course. Here is the outline, based on this view.

# Learning Outcomes:
By the end of the course, the students will be able to :
- formulate, design and analyze algorithms for problem statements.
- choose appropriate data structures and algorithms, understand the ADT/libraries, and use it to design algorithms for a specific problem.
- understand the necessary mathematical abstraction to solve problems.
- come up with analysis of efficiency and proofs of correctness
- comprehend and select algorithm design approaches in a problem specific manner.
