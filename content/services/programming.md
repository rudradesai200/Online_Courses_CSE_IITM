The computer is often a very handy tool when solving complex technical problems in engineering and scientific explorations. Programming a computer is a fundamental task in finding solutions to such problems. 

# Objectives
This course is being offered in order to train the undergraduate students in IIT Madras (from various engineering and science departments) in the fundamentals of programming.
The course aims to provide exposure to problem-solving through programming. It aims to train the student to the basic concepts of the C-programming language. This course involves a lab component which is designed to give the student hands-on experience with the concepts.

# Learning Outcomes
After the course the students are expected to be able to (this is what the exams will test) :
- Identify​ situations where computational methods and computers would be useful.
- Given a computational problem, identify and abstract​the programming task involved.
- Approach​ the programming tasks using techniques learned and write​ pseudo-code.
Choose​ the right data representation formats based on the requirements of the problem.
- Use​ the comparisons and limitations of the various programming constructs and choose​ the right one for the task in hand.
- Write ​the program on a computer, edit, compile, debug, correct, recompile and run it.
- Identify ​tasks in which the numerical techniques learned are applicable and apply them to write programs, and hence use ​computers effectively to solve the task.
